# Infinitely Deep Learning (DL∞)
Deep Learning without depth limitation! Now you can solve any problem in the world. Anything! 

Just to put it in simple terms, [Stephen Hawking's nightmare](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence-but-are-we-taking-9313474.html) has come true; you can "outsmart financial markets, out-invent human researchers, out-manipulate human leaders, and develope weapons we cannot even understand."

**Caution:** Be responsible! In fact if you don't have a sound mind (or you're like ISIS, Trump, etc), close this tab right now! 

Technologies used in this project: We use an [∞](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_computation)-layer network with all nodes connected to each other; so it subsumes all the existing architectures like recurrent, convolutional, feedforward, you name it! The nodes are powered by our awesome godly technology: "Infinitely linear nonlinear convex non-convex parameteric non-parameteric stochastic adversarial differential non-differential regularized boosted active attentional Bayesian ReLU.  
Unlike others we don't do BackPropagation. Instead we just use magic. Pretty straightforward, huh?

 Just a little teasing who are create fantacy stories AI, without . 
 And those who overhype findings. 
 
 Keep learning, creating and teaching and let our knowledge grow! May all us human live in a better and peaceful world.
